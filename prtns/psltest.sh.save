# Desc:  psltest.sh is used to confirm changes made to the PSL
#        compiler.  This runs through a series of PSL procedures
#        for a generic non-application level test of the compiler.
#        the focus is on data access (for database independence
#        and PSL language constructs.
#
#        The tests are responsible for data setup and teardown.
#        The tests are designed to be runable in any environment.

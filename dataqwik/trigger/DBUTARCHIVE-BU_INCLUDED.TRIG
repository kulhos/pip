	Validate that for any table name entered in the Include With column it
	is a related table, i.e., that it uses a different global, the key
	structure of both tables match exactly (datatype and length), and it
	has a filer, and it doesn't appear in DBUTARCHIVE as either a primary
	or included table for any other entries.
	
	Also, prevent a table from being removed from the included list if it
	already has archived data.
